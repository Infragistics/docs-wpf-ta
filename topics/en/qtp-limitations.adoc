== Recording Session Restart

=== Overview

The QuickTest Professional Product (QTP) requires that you restart the recording sessions whenever you enable or disable the `RecordBaseClick` feature in the settings utility.

Any setting that begins with Record such as `RecordBaseClick` affects the behavior of Test Automation with QTP while recording. Settings that affect the recording behavior, changed while recording, remain unapplied until you start a new recording session.

To start a new recording session you need to ensure the following:

* The current recording session is stopped (F4 – keyboard shortcut).

* A new recording session is Started (F3 – keyboard shortcut).

== QTP  _TableVerify_   Behavior with Large Data

Table verification of QTP exhibits a particular behavior, outlined below, when the control is bound to large amounts of data. QTP uses the following formula to compute the actual number of displayed rows:

`SuppliedRowNumber – (Floor (SuppliedRowNumber/65536) $$*$$ 65536)`.

When the number of rows in the control is less than or equal to 65,535, which is `(2^16)-1`, all of the rows display correctly; however, for data larger than 65,535, the actual number of rows displayed will be computed using the above formula.

Examples:

[cols="a"]
|====
|If the supplied number of rows to QTP’s  _TableVerify_   is 35000

|35000 – (Floor(35000/65536) $$*$$ 65536) 

=35000 – (Floor(0.534) $$*$$ 65536) 

=35000 – (0 $$*$$ 65536) 

=35000

[cols="a"]
|====
|If the supplied number of rows to QTP’s  _TableVerify_   is 65535

|65535 – (Floor(65535 /65536) $$*$$ 65536) 

=65535 – (Floor(0.99998) $$*$$ 65536) 

=65535 – (0 $$*$$ 65536) 

=65535
