== _XamRibbon_   Recordable Methods

[[_Ref353975872]]
== _OpenGroupDialog_

=== Description

This action launches the  _DialogBoxLauncherTool_   of a  _RibbonGroup_  .

image::images/xamRibbon_Recordable_Methods_Reference_1.png[]

=== Parameters

The following table explains the method’s parameter followed by code example.

[options="header", cols="a,a"]
|====
|Method parameter|Description

| _oGroupId_ 
|Unique identifier of the ribbon group among other ribbon groups. This identifier is the group’s header. 

If the group does not have a header or if the header is a duplicate, then the identifier will be the visible index of the group among other visible groups of the ribbon.

|====

=== Example

Clicking the  _DialogBoxLauncherTool_   (outlined in the above screenshot) records the following script.

[source,csharp]
----
WpfWindow("Window1").XamRibbon("xamRibbon").OpenGroupDialog ARRAY("RibbonGroup", "Format", 0, "DialogBoxLauncherTool")
----

=== Possible exceptions

The following exceptions will result from not being able to locate the  _DialogBoxLauncherTool_  :

* The  _oGroupId_   is null or missing
* The index of the ribbon group (if present) is out of range of the total existing ribbon groups
* The ribbon group (if present) does not match any of the headers of the existing ribbon groups
* The ribbon group is removed, collapsed or hidden
* The ribbon group does not have a  _DialogBoxLauncherTool_   or the  _DialogBoxLauncherTool_   is removed, collapsed or hidden in that group

[[_Ref353975881]]
== _SelectTab_

=== Description

Clicking on the selected tab of the ribbon identified by its  _oTabId_  . Selecting a  _ContextualTabGroup_   the first tab in that group is always selected by default and hence recorded as a selection of the first tab (not the  _ContextualTabGroup_  ).

The following screenshot illustrates this concept. Selecting the  _ContextualTabGroup_   will, by default, record the first RibbonTab in the group instead.

=== Parameters

The following table explains the method’s parameter followed by code example.

[options="header", cols="a,a"]
|====
|Method parameter|Description

| _oTabId_ 
|This is a unique identifier for the Ribbon tabs representing the tab header. 

If the tab does not have a header or if the header is duplicate, then the identifier will be the visible index of the tab among other visible tabs of the ribbon.

|====

=== Example

Clicking the contextual tab called “Selection” (Illustrated in the above screenshot) records the first ribbon tab instead.

[source,csharp]
----
WpfWindow("Window1").XamRibbon("xamRibbon").SelectTab "Font Selection"
----

=== Possible exceptions

The following exceptions will result from not being able to locate the tab:

* If the  _oTabId_   is null or missing
* The tab index (if present) is out of range of the total existing tabs
* The header (if present) does not match any of the headers of the existing tabs
* The tab is removed, collapsed or hidden

=== Parameters

The following table explains the method’s parameter followed by code example.

[options="header", cols="a,a"]
|====
|Method parameter|Description

| _oToolAction_ 
|This is an enumeration used to identify the type of action performed on a Ribbon tool. 

The enumerated values are: 

* Click = 0 

* SelectValue = 1 

* SetValue–=2 

* Activate =3 

* DropDown = 4 

* CloseUp = 5

* ApplicationMenuLeftArea 

* ApplicationMenuRecentItems 

* ApplicationMenuFooterToolbar 

* QuickAccessToolbar 

* QuickCustomizeMenu

The last parameter is the tool identifier which is the header of the tool, or its visible index (if the tool has no header or the header is a duplicate with another tool at the same level).

| _oToolValue_ 
|This is the new value of the editor based tool. Its value depends on the following conditions: 

1. If the tool is a Text editor base tool, it represents the value in the textbox of that tool. 

2. If the tool is a ComboEditor tool, it represents the selected item from the ComboBox dropDown. 

3. If the tool is a ToggleButton, it represents one of following values: 

* Check
