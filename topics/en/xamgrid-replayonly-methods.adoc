[[_CellEnterEditMode]]
== _CellEnterEditMode_

=== Description

The `CellEnterEditMode` method sets the specified cell in edit mode.

=== Details

When replaying the method:

[start=1]
. The specified cell path is validated
[start=2]
. The cell is activated
[start=3]
. A check is performed to verify that the editing is enabled
[start=4]
. The cell is set in edit mode

The method accepts as a parameter the cell path.

The path is formed by concatenating the row path and the column key (the parenthesis and the brackets are part of the syntax): *{row path}[column key]* 

For example, the cross-section of the first row and the column key is denoted as {0}[key], the cross-section of the first child row of the first row and the column key is denoted as {0}{0}[key].

=== Parameters

The following table maps the desired configuration to parameters settings.
