[[_Introduction]]

=== Introduction

The sample test applications and scripts of {ProductName} provide a quick overview of the important user actions that can be automated and reproduced. The tests invoke the corresponding WPF application to perform the automated test.

The tests are installed by default in the Samples folder. Their default location is C:\Users\Public\Documents\Infragistics\{ProductName} UFT {ProductVersion}\Samples\CLR4.0\Scripts\.

Each script is set up to automatically load its sample application from the Samples\Bin folder prior to running.
