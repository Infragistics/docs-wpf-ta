== xamSpreadsheet

=== Replay operation throws exception

The following exception “Type mismatch: …” is thrown during replay.

image::images/KnownIssues_and_BreakingChanges_2014_2_1.png[]

You may have noticed that this only happens when you close the AUT after recording and re-open the application on replay.

This happens when testing against the RTM version of the 14.2 IG xamSpreadsheet control. This is due to the fact that the RTM version of the control did not have a UIAutomationPeer defined for the control. This was added in the first service release, build 14.2.2024.

Workaround

.Note
[NOTE]
====
Build you AUT with the IG WPF xamSpreadsheet build of 14.2.2024 or later.
====

=== Standard Checkpoint is failing

This is likely due to the cells that were selected during record, were not selected on replay before the Standard CheckPoint table verification. To understand why this is an issue there are several things that must be understood:

* The TableVerification is based only on the ActiveSelection.ActiveCellRange
* To limit the excessive recording of SelectCells every time the selection changes we only record the SelectCells when data is changing or being copied on multiple cells.
* We cannot trigger a record of a SelectCells action in response to a CheckPoint call.

Workaround

.Note
[NOTE]
====
Either record a NameSelection prior to the StandardCheckpoint, which will in turn record a SelectCells for the current selection. Or hand script a SelectCells action corresponding to the Cells that you want to be verified.
====

=== Some UI actions not recorded

Because of the number of large controls included in the release of IG WPF control suite 14.2, some features were dropped from RTM support in IG TestAutomation so that it may be released in a timely manner. Support for these actions will be added in a later release.

== xamPropertyGrid

=== Reset button not being recorded

UFT\QTP is partially intercepting our recording operations against the context menu of the control. We are working to resolve this behavior but at this time this issue has not been resolved.

Workaround

.Note
[NOTE]
====
Manually script a PerformCommand prpgResetPropertyValue after selecting the property.
