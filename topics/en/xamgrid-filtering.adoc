[[_ClearFilterCell]]
== _ClearFilterCell_

=== Description

The  _ClearFilterCell_   deletes the content of the filter cell.

=== Details

The ClearFilterCell method is recorded in a test when the end user clicks the filter cell’s  _Clear_   button.

The following table maps the desired configuration to parameters settings.

[options="header", cols="a,a,a"]
|====
|In order to:|Use this parameter:|And set it to:

|Specify the filter cell to be cleared
|sCellArg
|The filter cell path

|====

=== Example

Setting a filter value for the  _Company_   column in the xamGrid first and then clearing the the filter.

[source,xaml]

----

=== Default setting

No default setting.

=== Possible exceptions

The following table lists the possible exceptions for the method and the reason that is likely to be causing them.
