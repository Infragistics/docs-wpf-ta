== Recordable Methods

=== Methods reference summary chart

The following table summarizes the purpose and functionality of the recordable methods for testing the sorting and grouping in the xamGrid control.

[options="header", cols="a,a"]
|====
|Method|Description

|_link:{ApiPlatform}test.controls.grids.xamgrid~infragisticswpf.test.controls.grids.xamgridproxybase~groupbycolumn.html[GroupByColumn]_
|Groups the data by a specified column.

|_link:{ApiPlatform}test.controls.grids.xamgrid~infragisticswpf.test.controls.grids.xamgridproxybase~sortcolumn.html[SortColumn]_
|Sorts the data by a specified column.

|_link:{ApiPlatform}test.controls.grids.xamgrid~infragisticswpf.test.controls.grids.xamgridproxybase~ungroupcolumn.html[UnGroupColumn]_
|Ungroups the data by a specified column.

|====

[[_GroupByColumn]]
== _GroupByColumn_

=== Description

The  _GroupByColumn_   method records and replays the grouping of data by a specified column.

=== Details

The GroupByColumn method is recorded in a test when:

[start=1]
. The xamGrid data is grouped by a column.
[start=2]
. Multiple-column grouping is performed by dragging column headers to other positions in the  _group_   _B_   _y_   area.

When replaying the method:

[start=1]
. The specified column header is verified.
[start=2]
. A check is performed to verify that grouping is allowed for the specified column.
[start=3]
. A check is performed to verify that the groupBy area is visible.
[start=4]
. The specified groupBy column header position in the groupBy area is verified.
[start=5]
. The grouping is performed.

The method accepts as parameters the column header name or the column header index in the groupBy area when multiple columns grouping is performed.

=== Parameters

The following table maps the desired configuration to its parameters’ settings.

[options="header", cols="a,a,a"]
|====
|In order to:|Use this parameter:|And set it to:

|Specify the grouping column by name
|sHeaderArg
|The column header name

|Specify the position of the grouping column
|iPosition
|The position of the header (integer)

|====

=== Example

Grouping data in the xamGrid by the  _Company_   column.

[source,xaml]
----
WpfWindow("WPFApplication1").XamGrid("xamGrid1").GroupByColumn "[Company]", 0
----

[[_Hlk322530508]]

=== Default setting

No default setting.

=== Possible exceptions

The following table lists the possible exceptions for the method and the reason that is likely to be causing them.

[options="header", cols="a,a,a"]

|*Exception name*|*Exception description*|*Possible reasons*

|[[_Hlk322530567]] 

The argument is malformed.
|The parameter’s format is incorrect.
|The method’s parameter is not in a valid format.

|The following item was not found.
|The specified item cannot be located when replaying the method.
|The method’s parameter is not correct.

|The element is not visible.
|The item is not visible and replaying the method fails.
|The item on which the action is performed either doesn’t exist or is hidden.

|The grouping position is out of range.
|The specified position is not valid and replaying the method fails.
|The specified position index is not in the valid range.

|_GroupBy_ support is not enabled.
|The _groupBy_ feature is not enabled and replaying the method fails.
|The groupBy feature is not allowed, either for the entire grid or for the specified column.

|====

[[_SortColumn]]
== _SortColumn_

=== Description

The  _SortColumn_   method records and replays the sorting of data by a specified column.

=== Details

The SortColumn method is recorded in a test when the column header is clicked and sorting is performed.

When replaying the method:

[start=1]
. The specified column header is verified.
[start=2]
. The specified sorting direction is verified.
[start=3]
. A check is performed to verify that checked if sorting is enabled.
[start=4]
. Sorting is performed.

The method accepts as parameters the column header name, the sorting direction, and a boolean parameter that indicates whether multiple-column sorting is performed.

The sorting direction options are listed in the link:xamgrid-enumeration-reference.html[xamGrid - Enumeration Reference] topic.

=== Parameters

The following table maps the desired configuration to its parameters’ settings.

[options="header", cols="a,a,a"]
|====
|In order to:|Use this parameter:|And set it to:

|Specify the sort column
|oColumn
|The column header

|Specify the sorting direction
|oSortDirection
|
* igAscending 

* igDescending 

* igNotSorted 

|Specify the sorting type (single-column or multiple-column)
|bExtendSort
|
* True 

* False 

* Empty (by default) 

|====

=== Example

Performing multiple xamGrid data sorting – first (primary) sorting by the  _CustomerID_   column and then sorting of the  _Company_   and  _ContactName_   columns.

[start=2]
. A check is performed to verify that grouping is allowed for the specified column.
[start=3]
. A check is performed to verify that the groupBy area is visible.
[start=4]
